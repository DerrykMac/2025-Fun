# Day 101

I know I said I would be talking about the wifilogger but I have something else to talk about today <br>
I spent the entire day Installing Windows on old PCs at my job, So might as well use today to rant about modern windows

<h4>Its bloated...</h4>

Windows is a User first, Tech nerd second type of OS, AND THATS OK!! <br>
its better than mac thats ALL USER and no tech nerd <br>
But they seem to not understand what people want from windows anymore, they keep pushing these usless features that no one asked for and all these background processes that no one needs OR CAN TURN OFF!!! 
Thats what I hate most... But we'll get to that later. <br>
Windows 7 was amazing, it was light, fast, looked AMAZING! and guess what? It was kinda bloated, a bunch of features not everybody needed but you could delete them, because they were apps and not baked into the OS. Also, these proccesses were not running in the background, they were just there if you needed them. <br>
It might sound outdated but every linux distro proves that wrong. Modern featurs yet light and fast. <br>
Windows... I NEED you to be better, bearly anyone supports linux, its hard to do anything over here but at least I have control over my OS. <br>
Yea we're at that part now, Windows... If i want to turn off a feature, I should be able to turn it off. There is no reason I should feel forced to use a feature I don't want. ON MY OWN COMPUTER!!! <br>
Even Ubuntu that shoves Snap packages down your throat, Snap packages that alot of people don't want. You know what it lets you do? DELETE THEM!!! <br>
If I want to Shut off Cortana, u know what I have to do? <br>
```bash
Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.549981C3F5F10 | Remove-AppxPackage
Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.WindowsFeedbackHub | Remove-AppxPackage
```
FUCK IS ALL DAT??? <br>
And worse of all it can just... COME BACK the next time I update my computer. (for the record I have no idea if that command works/ what it does, run at your own risk) <br>

But I will be honest, I dont hate windows, just windows 11 and windows 10 post 20H2 <br>
My favorite OS is actually Windows 2000, So im not just a linux fanboy shouting at the clouds <br>
Oh god I can list off a bunch of things I hate about linux... it aint perfect. <br>
BUT IT AINT WINDOWS 11!!! <br>

### ADDENDUM
This is so off topic, I'm putting this into a new MD file

### ADDENDUM 2
MOTHER FUCKING "I dont have internet" <br>
BITCH NOT EVERYONE LIVING IN THE BIG CITY, IM IN A FUCKING 3rd WORLD COUNTRY, I DONT GOT INTERNET 24/7 WHY DO I NEED TO USE A ***BYPASS*** TO GET MY OS INSTALED
Bypass for the record: `OOBE\BYPASSNRO` Hit <Shift + F10> Then enter that in the CMD <br>

### ADDENDUM 3
the ai reminded me of this one... but now that i remember... <br>
I DONT HAVE PERMISSION??? HU??? COME AGAIN??? <br>
WHY IS THERE A PERMISSION ***ABOVE THE FUCKING USER*** <br>
IF I SO DARE WANT TO DELETE SYSTEM32,  LET ME FUCKING DO IT <br>
Warn me by all means, make me go though 5 diffrent *ARE YOU SURE?* screens, but let me do it!! <br>
Here on Linux if you want to remove everything its one TINY command:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /
```
whats funny about that is if u want to delete the current folder its:
```bash
sudo rm -rf ./
```
Like... they should not be that close lol, but its funny
