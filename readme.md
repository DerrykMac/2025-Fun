# 365 days of Repos

## Day 1

This will be an interesting project, I will document my days in the MD for all the days in 2025, and maybe even do some coding, who knows
I have no idea how this will go, nor do i know if I will keep it up

<h3>FUN!!!</h3>

(No Code for day 1)

## Day 2

Today I want to talk about a cool coding trick I learned while coding pong for the... uh... 5th? no 4th time
I always used exact angles for the balls direction which seemed like the most obvious solution to me
It want until I was explaining to my friend the issue I was having with translationg the game to vinilla minecraft did I relize a new solution
A solution that not only solved my issue making the game with commandblocks, it also gets rid of all the bugs my previous iterations had

So I would like to share it today because I find it intresting, I do not know what solution the original pong used and it would be good to research it. but finding solutions to my problems myself is fun to me.
The code is in [Cool](Cool/1.2.25-Move_A_Ball.py)
