# 365 days of Repos

## Day 1

This will be an interesting project, I will document my days in the MD for all the days in 2025, and maybe even do some coding, who knows
I have no idea how this will go, nor do i know if I will keep it up

<h3>FUN!!!</h3>

(No Code for day 1)

## Day 2

Today I want to talk about a cool coding trick I learned while coding pong for the... uh... 5th? no 4th time
I always used exact angles for the balls direction which seemed like the most obvious solution to me
It want until I was explaining to my friend the issue I was having with translationg the game to vinilla minecraft did I relize a new solution
A solution that not only solved my issue making the game with commandblocks, it also gets rid of all the bugs my previous iterations had

So I would like to share it today because I find it intresting, I do not know what solution the original pong used and it would be good to research it. but finding solutions to my problems myself is fun to me.
The code is in [Cool](Cool/1.2.25-Move_A_Ball.py)

## Day 3

Ok I dont have any cool thing to share today, all I added to the folders was some baic functions in C and Java
These are functions that I keep remaking everytime I make a new engine, so i just decided to keep it in a folder here for refrence.
I have more of them in diffrent languages but I cant find the python one.
I'm pretty sure yesterday I had something planned to talk about but I forgot it, So I am adding a [Future Topics Text Document](FutureTopics.md) to write down any ideas to talk about.

Tommorow I am going to be very busy so i may miss that day or day 4 might be short

## Day 4

Today I did screamed into a mic for a sound test... not knowing i was live...
besides that today is too stressfull to write anything.

## Day 6

And just like that... I missed day 5 lol

Today I will like to talk about old Operating Systems, Like DOS and Windows 3.1
Years ago I started using old OSs like DOS 5.0 for coding and I think it stuck with me because im still worried about 32bit filename errors lol.
Besides that I think the limitations help me become a better programmer and help me get better at CMD.
Also I miss GOTO command in languages, yes it can lead to confusions and messy code, but sometimes I want to just hop back to the top of the code without having all my lines check for a condition.

GOTO aside, I think working under limitation is a great skill teacher that helps you improve your skills, You'll see more often during this ReadMe that I love working under limitations.
A couple things to look forward to:

- Wordle in excel
- A screensaver for the TI84 Calculator
- A 3d render engine for the console with Ascii
