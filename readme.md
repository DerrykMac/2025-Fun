# 365 days of Repos

## Day 1

This will be an interesting project, I will document my days in the MD for all the days in 2025, and maybe even do some coding, who knows
I have no idea how this will go, nor do i know if I will keep it up

<h3>FUN!!!</h3>

(No Code for day 1)

## Day 2

Today I want to talk about a cool coding trick I learned while coding pong for the... uh... 5th? no 4th time
I always used exact angles for the balls direction which seemed like the most obvious solution to me
It want until I was explaining to my friend the issue I was having with translating the game to vanilla minecraft did I realize a new solution
A solution that not only solved my issue making the game with commandblocks, it also gets rid of all the bugs my previous iterations had

So I would like to share it today because I find it interesting, I do not know what solution the original pong used and it would be good to research it. but finding solutions to my problems myself is fun to me.
The code is in [/Cool](Cool/1.2.25-Move_A_Ball.py)

## Day 3

Ok I don't have any cool thing to share today, all I added to the folders was some basic functions in C and Java
These are functions that I keep remaking every time I make a new engine, so i just decided to keep it in a folder here for reference.
I have more of them in different languages but I cant find the python one.
I'm pretty sure yesterday I had something planned to talk about but I forgot it, So I am adding a [Future Topics Text Document](FutureTopics.md) to write down any ideas to talk about.

Tomorrow I am going to be very busy so i may miss that day or day 4 might be short

## Day 4

Today I screamed into a mic for a sound test... not knowing i was live...
besides that today is too stressful to write anything.

## Day 6

And just like that... I missed day 5 lol

Today I will like to talk about old Operating Systems, Like DOS and Windows 3.1
Years ago I started using old OSs like DOS 5.0 for coding and I think it stuck with me because im still worried about 32bit filename errors lol.
Besides that I think the limitations help me become a better programmer and help me get better at CMD.
Also I miss GOTO command in languages, yes it can lead to confusions and messy code, but sometimes I want to just hop back to the top of the code without having all my lines check for a condition.

GOTO aside, I think working under limitation is a great skill teacher that helps you improve your skills, You'll see more often during this ReadMe that I love working under limitations.
A couple things to look forward to:

- Wordle in excel
- A screensaver for the TI84 Calculator
- A 3d render engine for the console with Ascii

## Day 8

Missed another day...

I can see that I am going to miss a lot of days and tracking the days is going to get a whole lot harder past january. So I've made a [Python script](Testing/WhatDay.py) to track the days for me

For todays interesting iota, I set up obsidian because I wanted to take notes in MD format.<br>
Im going to try get the cloud synchronization up and working when I get back from work.

## Day 9

Today I had to help rush pack a bunch of kids for a trip tomorrow (Im not going lol)<br>
didn't do anything too interesting today, Uh... I got a fax machine to work on linux after like 4 months of it not working. All I did was download HP drivers lol <br>
`sudo apt install hplip-gui` then `hp-setup`

## Day 11

Pain and suffering

## Day 15

So... My computer exploded ðŸ’€ <br>
Yea so I could have continued this on a different PC, but I was so focused on getting my laptop fixed I forgot this existed

Anywho, Today I will be trying to write a particle engine, but first I am going to write a basic static collision system, update on that tomorrow (If I get the chance to work on it today)

## Day 20

Ok I have no excuse this time, I simply forgot.

I did finish the collision system yesterday thou so if I did a day 16 I wouldn't have much to say. <br>
The collision system works quite simply, theres 3 components

- Map collision
- Object collision
- Particle collision

The Map collision was the simplest as it just detects if a 16x16 square chunk is filled ot not (Or any size you set it to)
(Its a 2d pixel engine btw) <br>
The Particle collision was interesting, it doesn't effect Objects but it is effected by objects, also its basically the same as the map but for 1 pixel <br>
The Object collision is alot more difficult and I am not fully finished with it. But essentially there are 2 types of collisions shapes: -Square & -Circle
And then theres 4 functions to describe how to know if they collided<br>
I will but in a system that checks every frame but also, only checks if the distance is close, otherwise to save recourses it wont check

Here's a sample code:

```C++
bool CheckCollisionCircleCircle(CollisionObject* other) {
	float distance = sqrt(pow(Position.x - other->Position.x, 2) + pow(Position.y - other->Position.y, 2));
	if (distance < Size.x + other->Size.x) {
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}
```

Thats all for today, I'll try not forget tomorrow :P

## Day 23

Quite simply... I hate dealing with Threads

## Day 42

Welp... I forgeot this existed oh well not going to quit just because I missed a few days <br>
Lets see how how much I can remember from the past 20 days

### I moved over to Linux
Specifically Ubuntu 20.04, I got sick and tired of windows so I finally made the switch, I still have a windows partition for... job reasons but If I need need to run a windows program and wine doesn't work I have a VM

### I Published a game (demo)
After 3 years of making games under my indie group and just, not publishing anything, I finally published a finished game!!!<br>
Its a demo cuz we plan on expanding the game (We made it for a Jam)
Check it out: [Bubblexity on Itch.io](https://bchaotic.itch.io/bubblexity)

### Minor updates
- Added a new function to [Basic.h](Saving/BasicLibs/Basic.h) , Just a way to check if something is a prime number
- Relized while uploading I dont have git on my linux PC, will download now lol

Besides that, I can't remember much else <br>
For the future: Imma try convert my game engine to linux and see how that goes, probably gunna pull my hair out, but oh well...

Anywho check out the game ðŸ«µ <br>
See you in another month lol

## Day 52
How did I forget for EXACTLY 10 days... oh well 

Today I bring to you a line of code to get ur IP on bash
```bash
ifconfig | grep -Eo 'inet (addr:)?([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*' | grep -Eo '([0-9]*\.){3}[0-9]*' | grep -v '127.0.0.1'
```
Nothing too intresting tbh, I just needed it and wanted to save it somewhere
Anywho, I do want to talk about something cool from linux
### NETCAT!!
Netcat is so cool!! You can use it to send commands over the network and because of unix piping u can use it for files too!! <br>
On the recieving end you use `nc -l  [port]` and on the sending end you can use `nc [ip] [port]` <br>
Ofc we cant forget the piping `cat [file] | nc [ip] [port]` <br>
And BOOM! the output of the file gets sent over the network <br>
You can use that to send files by piping the file in and out <br>
recieving end: `nc -l [port] > [file]` <br>
sending end: `nc [ip] [port] < [file]` <br>
And there you go, you can send files over the network with netcat <br>

idk... I find it cool lol <br>
anywho Imma def forget tmmr so hopefully I remember in less than 10 days this time

## Day 100!!
Ok I HAD to post one on day 100 <br>
Not much to say... I forgot this existed again until I saw it was day 100 <br>
uh... Ive been working on a wifilogger program for the past few days, I can talk about it more in the future <br>
For now... I added a new Basic lib to the [Basic Libs](Saving/BasicLibs) folder (This time for python) <br>
[Basic.py](Saving/BasicLibs/Basic.py) <br>

See you in another 100 days lol (Hopefully not)

### Day 100 Addendum
Wow There are alot of things I want to talk about, and I just added a bunch to [FutureTopics.md](FutureTopics.md) <br>
Hopefully I can remember to post more often so I can talk about all the things I want to talk about <br>

You will see this update when I post again cuz I dont want to commit 2 times in a day lol <br>

## Day 101
**I REMEMBERED!!!**

So I made a whole rant about windows but It doesn't fit the vibe here So I put it in a [different file](Rants.md)

Because I'm kinda tired of writing after the rant, I will talk about a reletivly simple topic <br>

### `wget`
Its cool... <br>
Its a bash command that lets you download files from the internet <br>
Sometimes If I want to download a raw file on a webserver like github or Internet Archive, I just use wget <br>
```bash
wget [url]
```
its that simple <br>

Aiit See ya...

## Day 103
Not only did I miss day 102, I somehow never commited day 101... <br>

## Day 104
And... I forgot to commit again... <br>

Today I will talk about Microcontrollers, and C; More so C <br>
Alot of people hate C/C++ and I get it, its one of the only languages that if you tell it to blow up ur computer, it wont ask questions or stop you... It will just do it <br>
Personally I like the full control it has, no restrictions lets me do whatever I want,
But on microcrontrollers I think its critical to use C/C++ <br>
Tell me, how many languages lets you strip it down to the bare minimum. In C u have to import the PRINT function, thats not built in. In other languages you have no choice. Now what use does a print function have on a microcontroller? <br> 
None <br>
And when ur working with a device that can bearly hold 1 .wav file of someone speaking, Its very important to use as little space as possible <br>

C is good for alot of other things too, its speed and versatility is amazing, and the reason why its still used to this day. But I wanted to focus on microcontrollers <br>

Expecially after finding out Python based microcontrollers exist... <br>

## Day 105
Ok I'll talk about the Wifi logger lol

I'm not gunna yap in this one so backstory later, but I had an intresting issue to solve

The Code made a live barchart with one bar being 1 character wide, using `"â–Œ"` character to build the bar <br>
But inorder to actually usefull, I need to know what time each bar was created (The bars relate to the wifi strength, relitive to the other readings) <br>
But the issue is.. I only have 1 character to work with, and if you ever seen time before, its more than 1 character, more like 3-5 `HH:MM` <br>

So how do I store any time into 1 char without loosing any data? Well I decided to use base64 (for the minuets), but what about the hours? I hear you asking across the screen frantically reading this random entry on a long readme.md file...
Well I used COLOUR!! <br>

```python
def GetTimeCode(Hour, Minute):

    #Convert Minute to 1 digit in base64
    Minute = Basic.base64_chars[Minute]
    #Convert Hour to hue
    Col = int((Hour / 24) * 360)
    ColRGB = Basic.HueToRGB(Col)

    #Make pixel
    Pix = Pixel()
    Pix.R = ColRGB[0]
    Pix.G = ColRGB[1]
    Pix.B = ColRGB[2]
    Pix.P = Minute
    
    return Pix
```
```python
def HueToRGB(hue):
    # Convert hue to RGB
    if hue < 0 or hue > 360:
        raise ValueError("Hue must be between 0 and 360 degrees")
    
    c = 1
    x = c * (1 - abs((hue / 60) % 2 - 1))
    m = 0

    if hue < 60:
        r, g, b = c, x, m
    elif hue < 120:
        r, g, b = x, c, m
    elif hue < 240:
        r, g, b = m, c, x
    elif hue < 300:
        r, g, b = x, m, c
    else:
        r, g, b = c, m, x

    return int((r + m) * 255), int((g + m) * 255), int((b + m) * 255)
```

Basically This gave me a colour coded hex char That I can use to figure out the time <br>
Also If you look at the characters I used for the Base64 Conversion:
`"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@#abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-+/"`<br>
I made the first 26 characters the letters, followed by 3 symbols before going back to letters. So I can easily tell what letter is what time <br>
Like if i see lowercase "f" I know "a" is 30 and can work from there <br>

Ofcourse your not gunna remember the colors off your head, so I put a refrence chart (toggable) in program <br>
```python
if not Help: #HELP is a bool toggled with "h"
	# STUFF
else:
	
	TextToPixel(Basic.base64_chars, UpperGrid, WIDTH - 65 , 0) #This is for base64 chars incase i forget the alphabet lol
	
	#This is for the colors, and it gives the time too, issue thou is times like 12 are written as 21 :P
	x = WIDTH  # Start at the far right
	for T in range(25):
		Col = int((T / 24) * 360)
		ColRGB = Basic.HueToRGB(Col)

		digits = list(str(T))  # handles 1 or 2 digit numbers
		for d in digits:
			Pix = Pixel()
			Pix.R = ColRGB[0]
			Pix.G = ColRGB[1]
			Pix.B = ColRGB[2]
			Pix.P = d
			PlacePixel(Pix, UpperGrid, x, 1)
			x -= 1  # move left for next digit

		x -= 1  # extra space between numbers
```

Thats it for today, I'll try talk about grabbing user input asynchronously next time 

Also for the record, I will make all the code for this app opensource when I finish it, (in like 10 years lol) <br>
Its very much a side project and I can't focus on it.

## Day 119
Shut it

Anywho have you guys heard of `whois`? Cuz I didn't until 20 minutes ago <br>
```bash
whois [ip/domain]
```
It gives you information for an ip address, like the owner and when it was registered <br>
Thats it for today, bye

## Day 230
Man I really overslept... What I missed? <br>
100+ days? Yea sound about accurate

Way too much has happened for me to possibly cover it all, so I will say some highlites

- Coded a Barcode scanner
- Learn QT6
- Made a NAS
- Started Development for my own Custom Music player that I am going to manufacture
- Learned about Micro Displays
- Learned the `yes` command in Linux
- Got a raspberry Pi
- Continued work on my Game
- Tried helping my friend with making a Custom CPU
- Failed with a friend to make a Custom CPU
- Learned Node.JS
- Learned Expo
- Made a SQL Database

Anywho, This isn't me coming back to this, I still want to do it, but too often this flashes into my head in an inopportune time to write anything, So now that I broke the Ice again, I will try to update when I can. <br>
There's still ALOT of topics in [FutureTopics.md](FutureTopics.md) (And I just added more), So I have plenty to talk about, Just need the time to write it.

Thats all for now, See you in another 100 days...

### Day 230 Addendum
I Want to try this again 2026, and 2027 and future years until I actually do 365 days
